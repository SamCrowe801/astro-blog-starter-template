If you’ve ever been in a car with Manny, you already know: *it’s not just driving, it’s a lifestyle.*

Manny treats every road like the Pacific Coast Highway—even if it’s just a Walmart parking lot.  
One hand on the wheel, the other hand holding a burrito, blasting West Coast rap like he’s late for a casting call in *Fast & Furious 12: Fresno Drift.*

## 🚦 Manny’s Driving Philosophy
Manny once said:  
> “Stop signs are really just suggestions, bro.”

Here’s how Manny interprets the rules of the road:
- **Green light:** Chill, we’ll get there eventually.  
- **Yellow light:** Floor it like Vin Diesel owes you money.  
- **Red light:** Depends—are there witnesses?  
- **Speed bumps:** Personal launch ramps.

## 🌴 The California Starter Pack
If you want to drive like Manny, here’s your checklist:
1. Sunglasses at night (for the vibes).  
2. Sand permanently stuck in the floor mats.  
3. A playlist that switches between Tupac, Sublime, and “Hotel California.”  
4. An air freshener shaped like a palm tree, even if you’ve never seen a real one.

## 🗣️ Passenger Reviews
- “It’s like Uber… if Uber had no brakes.”  
- “Pretty sure my soul left my body at that last merge.”  
- “5 stars, would not recommend.”

So next time you hear tires screeching and someone yelling *“YEEEEE”* out the window, don’t panic.  
That’s just Manny—living his best California dream, one questionable lane change at a time.
