      <h1>🚗 Manny Drives Like He’s From California 🌴</h1>
      <p>
        Manny doesn’t just drive. He <em>glides</em>. He rolls up with one hand on the wheel,
        the other holding a gas station burrito, blasting 90s West Coast rap like he’s starring
        in his own music video.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Manny’s Driving is Legendary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>He signals left but turns right (classic Manny move).</li>
        <li>Parallel parking? More like <em>“perpendicular art installation.”</em></li>
        <li>Stops at green lights, floors it at yellows — Manny time.</li>
        <li>Claims his Prius “has turbo” (no one believes him).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Manny’s California Driving Starter Pack 🌴</h2>
      <p>If you want to drive like Manny, here’s what you’ll need:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A car that rattles but never dies.</li>
        <li>Sunglasses at night (for the vibes).</li>
        <li>Beach sand permanently stuck in the floor mats.</li>
        <li>An endless playlist of Tupac, Sublime, and “Hotel California.”</li>
      </ol>

      <blockquote>
        “Manny drives like he’s from California — because deep down, he probably is.”  
        <br />– Every passenger who survived the ride
      </blockquote>

      <h2>🚦 Manny’s Rules of the Road</h2>
      <p>
        According to Manny, traffic laws are more like “traffic suggestions.” He says,
        <strong>“If I beat the GPS time, I win.”</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Next time you see a car cruising by with the windows down, palm tree air freshener swinging,
        and a guy yelling “YEEEEE” out the window — don’t worry. That’s just Manny being Manny.
