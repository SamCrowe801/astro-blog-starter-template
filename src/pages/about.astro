    Manny drives like he’s from California 🌴🚗. And honestly? That’s all you really
    need to know. But since this is the “About Me” page, let’s go a little deeper
    into the myth, the man, and the questionable braking decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Born somewhere between a palm tree and a freeway overpass, Manny was destined
    to hit the gas. He treats every speed bump as a launch ramp, every red light
    as “optional if you squint,” and every parking space as a personal challenge
    to the laws of geometry.
  </p>

  <p>
    His passengers describe him as “thrilling,” “terrifying,” and “a free rollercoaster
    experience with poor suspension.” Yet somehow, Manny always gets them to their
    destination a solid five minutes faster than the GPS predicted.
  </p>

  <h2>🚦 Manny’s Signature Moves</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using turn signals only as decoration.</li>
    <li>Blasting Sublime while merging across three lanes at once.</li>
    <li>Rolling down the window just to yell “YEEEEE” at random intervals.</li>
    <li>Claiming his car has turbo when it’s clearly a 2004 Corolla.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Manny lives by a simple motto: <strong>“If I beat the ETA, I win.”</strong>
    It doesn’t matter if it’s a grocery run, a road trip, or just driving around
    the block — Manny is out here chasing personal bests.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Manny drives like he’s from California… because deep down, he probably is.”
    <br />– Everyone who’s ever survived a ride
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    So if you’re ever cruising the highway and a car zips past you with sand in the
    floor mats, sunglasses at night, and a driver grinning like he’s in a music video,
    don’t panic. That’s just Manny. And he’s already late for something.
